## About

This was my first application built using Node.js, with the objective of studying and familiarizing myself with backend web development. Additionally, it was created to provide me with daily information about currency rates from Euro to Real, helping me determine the best date to send money to Brazil.

In this project, I utilized the following:

* [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/) as the Node.js framework.
* [**Frankfurter API**](https://www.frankfurter.app/) for retrieving currency rates.
* [**Quickchart**](https://quickchart.io/) for generating charts.
* [**Emailjs**](https://www.emailjs.com/) for sending emails.

I learned a lot about the infrastructure of Node.js and how it operates through this project.
